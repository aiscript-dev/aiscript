> **AiScript** is a scripting language that runs on JavaScript. Not altJS.

[Play online â–¶](https://aiscript-dev.github.io/aiscript/)

AiScript is a multi-paradigm programming language that runs on JavaScript, not AltJS (1).

* First-class support for arrays, objects, functions, etc.
* Flexibility, including conditional branches and blocks can be treated as expressions
* Easy to write, no need for semicolons or commas
* Runs in a secure(2) sandbox environment
* Variables and functions can be provided from the host

> (1) ... It "runs on" JavaScript, not is "converted" to JavaScript. Therefore, it is not AltJS.

> (2) ... Not being able to access the host's information.

This repository contains parsers and processors implemented in JavaScript.

Note: AiScript and [Misskey](https://github.com/syuilo/misskey) are completely independent projects. AiScript does not prescribe any specific host, but Misskey is the largest user of AiScript (today!)
